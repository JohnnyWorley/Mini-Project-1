Mini-Project 1: Node Generation

I made this as a basis for a dungeon-generation game. It will generate a unique order of rooms and can go North, East, South, West and Vertical when generating rooms. If it encounters a point where the room is encircled and can't generate a new room in any direction then after 100 attempts it will reset the scene and attempt to create the desired amount of rooms again.
